Case study: Data-driven transformation of Springfield’s police force
Springfield, Virginia in the United States of America has been collecting data on the crimes that have been occurring in the city boundaries between
1998 and 2019. The data includes details on the offender, the nature of the crime, the location of the crime, and further details. The dataset contains
over 23,000 instances of crimes which have occurred.
Due to increasing negative media attention, there is a growing perception by the citizens of Springfield that they are no longer safe. They are starting
to complain and resent the elected officials. Because next year is an election year, the Mayor, Mayor Jones, is growing increasingly concerned about
the social welfare of the citizens she is responsible for. Mayor Jones has previously delegated the responsibility of the crime portfolio to her police
chief, Chief Odinson. It is Chief Odinson’s responsibility to run the entire police force across the areas within Springfield: Central Springfield (postal
code: 22150), North Springfield (postal code: 22151), and West Springfield (postal code: 22152).
Mayor Jones organised to meet with Chief Odinson to gather the information she needed to transform the city. When she met with Chief Odinson,
the Chief was perplexed, he was unsure on how to gather the information the Mayor required. The Chief did know that the police officers in each
precinct within each area completed reports about every case (some initiated by the victim, others by witnesses). He also knew that the data on the
reports was inputted into an Excel file. Yet, he was not sure on how to extract what he needed from the data file.
Recognising his uncertainty and wanting to provide the necessary information to the Mayor, Chief Odinson decided to hire your team of consultants
to see how they can best leverage the data that the Chief had access to. Yet, rather than just finding the information to assist Mayor Jones, the Chief
decided to take this opportunity to improve how he manages the police. He also met with Police Officer, Sergeant Steve Rogers to see if there is
anything data-related that could help the Sergeant perform his duties. Sergeant Rogers informed the Chief that many of his fellow police officers of
the Springfield Police Department required more information to understand the nature of the crimes in the area, so that they can be better equipped
to respond.
Stakeholder groups
You are required to identify a data-driven approach to provide insights in the form of a digital dashboard to assist the following stakeholders:
Mayor Jones – to improve societal issues surrounding crimes (focus on all suburbs overall).
Chief Odinson – to manage the Springfield Police Department in Central Springfield, North Springfield, and West Springfield (compare the three
suburbs).
Sergeant Rogers – to be more informed of the crimes in the local areas (focus on one suburb only).
